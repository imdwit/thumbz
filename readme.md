# thumbz

Inspired by [React Thumb Preview](https://github.com/caike/React-Thumb-Preview) from [Carlos Souza](https://github.com/caike), I wanted to recreate it with pure js, no libraries.
I was curious to see how it compared to React. I average around 8.194â€‰ms Painting.
Compared to Carlos's 6ms with react.
I'm running Chrome Version 44.0.2403.155 (64-bit) on a 13in 2012 macbook pro with 16gb ram and ssd.

mouseover or slide your thumb across the image

## todo
* probably try more images, and images of different sizes
* try it out in different projects (load images in via ajax, or upload from device)
* probably wait until images are loaded to add event listener
* improve mobile functionality
